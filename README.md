# ALS2TXT

## Problem Statement 

The core objective of this project is to ensure a solid understanding of the fundamentals of computer vision and image processing. The project entails developing a system that converts American Sign Language (ASL) into text using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Phases

### [Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning and Python](<./Week 1/>)
This week will be a lighter one for those already familiar with Python. For those who are new, we have got you covered. 
- [Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) : Watch till 3:36:00, try to write the code and try running them, this goes for all further tutorials 
- [Python Classes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-classes-and-objects/)
- [Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)
- [Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)
- [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB9C0Mz9gSo)

Assignment : Test your Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib concepts
- [W1_Assignment1](<./Week 1/Assignment_1.ipynb>) 
- [W1_Assignment1 dataset](<./Week 1/countries.csv>)

NOTE : 
- You have to submit the Collab link of the assignment with comment access, the google form will be floated on the group
- Do not use ChatGpt (as if this is going to stop you in doing so)
- This applies for all further assignments

### [Week 2: Introduction to Machine Learning](<./Week 2/>)
Theory for Machine Learning
- [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
- [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
- Apply for financial aid for these courses, and while applying, audit the course for free. Watch the videos at 2x speed; no need to complete assignments. By auditing the course, you can immediately access the videos for free without waiting for financial aid approval.
Code
- [Developing code for machine learning algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_LwzRVP7bg)
- The datasets and google collab files are provided in the video description, please try to implement the code for better understanding.
